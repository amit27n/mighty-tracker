# mighty-tracker
A project to track any resource time usage 

How it works.

1. register a resource which does not have unlimited availability. It could be anything. A community facility(ex. tennis court, swimming pool), a common meeting room. 
2. Define availability constrints.
2. Register users for that resource.
3. define the resource allocation algorithm.
4. track usage.
